push -> add to end and returns the new size of the array
pop -> remove from end and returns the removed value
Shift -> remove from start and returns the removed element
unshift -> adds to start and returns the new length of the array

concat -> merge arrays 
includes -> look for a value and returns true or false if value is found or not found 
indexOf -> just like str.indexOf, returns the index and -1 if element is not present 
join -> creates a string from array 
reverse -> reverses an array in place(it mutates the array)
slice -> copy portion of an array 
splice -> remove/replace elements also inserts in between 
sort -> sorts an array 


forEach -> Accepts a callback function. calls the function once per element in the array 

Map -> creates a new array with the results of calling a callback on every element in the array
        Map doesnot mutates the array, it maps the values into new array 

find -> returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function
    
        the function that is passed as callback , must return true or false(i.e boolean function)

filter -> creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function 

Every -> tests whether all elements in the array pass the provided function. It returns a Boolean value 

Some -> Similar to every, but returns true if ANY of the array elements pass the test function
